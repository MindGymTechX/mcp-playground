# MCP Playground

This repository explores the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a
standardized way to expose tools and data to LLM-driven agents.

## Why MCP
APIs are designed for humans and programs.
MCP is designed for AI agents.

This repo demonstrates:
- Exposing existing APIs via MCP
- Tool discovery and schemas
- Safe execution boundaries
- Integration with agent runtimes
